      "The education system is organized into key stages; early childhood, primary and secondary, higher, and vocational education. The challenges\n",
      "in the education system influence human capital formation of the country. These challenges span across various dimensions including access,\n",
      "quality, affordability and relevance. Lack of enrollment in early childhood education, high enrollment rate in primary education but\n",
      "disparities in terms of secondary education, a high demand for university education but limited capacity to accommodate all qualified students\n",
      "and a growing demand for technical and vocational education but not meeting labour market requirements are major challenges in the sector.\n",
      "Therefore, addressing these issues require education sector reforms to ensure inclusive and responsive education system.\n",
      "Health sector in Sri Lanka faces several challengers that impact its ability to provide equitable, efficient and high-quality healthcare to its\n",
      "population. By fostering efficiency, transparency, and innovation, it addresses the challenges in health promotion, disease prevention, and\n",
      "digital transformation across primary, secondary, and tertiary care systems while strengthening accountability, safety standards, and inclusive\n",
      "service delivery.\n",
      "Housing is another major concern, especially for low-income families in urban areas who lack basic amenities. Rural housing faces similar\n",
      "challenges, including unclear land ownership and high construction costs. Although, the government aims to tackle some of these issues by\n",
      "developing multi-story housing complexes. A lot more need to be done to ease the housing burden on low to medium income families.\n",
      "Sports and culture are vital for community development; however, certain key decision making areas hindered the progress. Therefore, it is\n",
      "essential to revitalize both sectors to foster positive societal contributions.\n",
      "Meantime, environmental mismanagement has long been a pressing challenge, leading to land degradation and water shortages, highlighting\n",
